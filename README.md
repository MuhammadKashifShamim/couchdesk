### Welcome to an advanced Open Source Corporate Help Desk.

After its initial fork Couchdesk has quickly evolved into a battleproof helpdesk system which aims to be simple to use and yet powerful in its capabilities to manage complex support team scenarios. 

Couchdesk is now a powerful self-hosted solution to fast track, manage and coordinate hundreds of issues & tasks while keeping control over the ticket workflows. Couchdesk can provide you with an essential client support platform as well as help your teams to overcome difficulties with their internal processes.

### Fully functional extensions
The following list of additions and changes should give you an idea how we got from a rather unfinished draft to a complete and powerful, yet simple to use corporate version:

- Workflow oriented permission and user system overhaul
- Lots of improvements of the internal messaging to provide visually appealing out of the box mails
- Optimization of menu structures, views and functionalities
- Many visual improvements and simplifications to provide an easier yet more powerful experience
- A more project based approach 
- Powerful optimization of typical daily work setups
- Better possibilites for client access rules and restrictions
- Lots of important bug fixes and functionality completion

### Current ongoing efforts
We are still working hard to brush off some dust and polish the edges. These are the remaining issues we are currently working on:

- Responsiveness of UI must be smooth and optimized
- Mobile View has to provide greater an essential minimum of usability when compared to the desktop UI
- Visual appearance of mail messaging must be flawless

### Online Demo
An online demo is NOT YET available. We will provide one for your convenience shortly at <a href="http://docker.couchdesk.net">http://docker.couchdesk.net</a>. <br />
